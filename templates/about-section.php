                <p class="large-intro-text">I'm Reuben, a multimedia journalist with a background in design. I'm interested in very big problems and the human lives within them.</p>

                <p>Think the migrant workers propping up continental food systems; the complex personal costs of the huge projects we need to combat the climate crisis; the local planning board decisions that gum up national housing targets; the individual innovators pushing change in big businesses and organisations.</p>
                <p>This year, I'm pursuing these stories as a <a href="https://cronkite.asu.edu/specializations/business-journalism-fellowship-graduate-fellowship/">Steele Fellow in Investigative Business Journalism</a> at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University.</p>
                <p>Before this, I was Digital Editor at The Architectural Review, where I wrote on architecture and politics and worked on devising and delivering cross-platform audience strategy.</p>
                <p>I graduated from the University of Cambridge, where I was president of the student architecture society, self-funding, designing, and delivering our annual exhibition in London – among much else. I was Production Assistant at The World Around, a New York-based global design platform where I helped to launch the Young Climate Prize, and worked on TV shoots for BBC Maestro.</p>
                <p>My first gig – at two months old – was a starring role in the music video for "You Were Right" by Badly Drawn Boy.</p>
