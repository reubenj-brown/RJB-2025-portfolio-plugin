                <h3 class="serif-font-scaled">Hi – I’m Reuben, a multimedia journalist with a background in design. I’m interested in very big problems and the human lives within them.</h3><br>
                <p>This year, I’ll be pursuing stories like this as a Steele Fellow in Investigative Business Journalism at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University.</p>
                <p>Before this, I was Digital Editor at The Architectural Review, working on audience strategy across platforms. I wrote on architecture and politics at the AR, at the architecture triennial in Sharjah,  or on Syrian refugee centres Turkey, or the architecture of protest in Central Europe. I graduated from the University of Cambridge, where I was president of (likely) the world’s only student architecture society to self-fund, self-design and self-deliver its university’s annual exhibition: displaying 250 students’ work in central London. I was also Production Assistant at The World Around, a New York-based global design platform, where I helped to launch the Young Climate Prize, and worked on TV shoots for BBC Maestro.</p>
                <p>My first gig – at two months old – was a starring role in the music video for "You Were Right" by Badly Drawn Boy.</p>
