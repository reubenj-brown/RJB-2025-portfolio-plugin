                <p class="large-intro-text">I’m Reuben, a multimedia journalist with a background in design. I’m interested in very big systems, the people shaping them, and the people they shape.</p>

                <p class="about-text">Think the migrant workers propping up continental food systems; the local tradeoffs of nation-spanning climate projects; the picayune planning edicts that gum up city housing targets; the individual innovators pushing change in big businesses and organisations.</p>
                <p class="about-text">This year, I’m pursuing these stories as a <a href="https://cronkite.asu.edu/specializations/business-journalism-fellowship-graduate-fellowship/">Steele Fellow in Investigative Business Journalism</a> at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University.</p>
                <p class="about-text">Before this, I was Digital Editor at <i>The Architectural Review</i>, where I wrote on architecture and politics and worked on cross-platform audience strategy. I graduated from the University of Cambridge, where I was president of the architecture society, delivering an exhibition of 250 students’ work in London, amongst much else. I was Production Assistant at The World Around, a New York-based design platform where I helped to launch the Young Climate Prize, and worked on TV shoots for BBC Maestro.</p>
                <p class="about-text">My first gig – at two months old – was a starring role in the <a href="https://youtu.be/K1BNOzDnOLI?t=202"> music video</a> for “You Were Right” by Badly Drawn Boy.</p>
