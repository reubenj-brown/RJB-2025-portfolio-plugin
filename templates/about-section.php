                <p>Reuben is digital editor at The Architectural Review, where he writes on architecture and politics. He also works on cross-platform audience strategy and editorial operations. This year, he'll be pursuing investigative stories as a <a href="https://cronkite.asu.edu/specializations/business-journalism-fellowship-graduate-fellowship/">Steele Fellow in Investigative Business Journalism</a> at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University.</p>
                <p>He graduated from the University of Cambridge, where he was president of (likely) the world's only student architecture society to self-fund, self-design and self-deliver its university's annual exhibition. He was also Production Assistant at The World Around, a New York-based global design platform, where he helped to launch the Young Climate Prize, and worked on TV shoots for the BBC.</p>
                <p>His first gig – at two months old – was a starring role in the music video for "You Were Right" by Badly Drawn Boy.</p>
