                <p class="about-text">Before this, I was Digital Editor at <i>The Architectural Review</i>, where I wrote on architecture and politics and worked on cross-platform audience strategy. I graduated from the University of Cambridge, where I was president of the architecture society, delivering an exhibition of 250 students’ work in London, amongst much else. I was Production Assistant at The World Around, a New York-based design platform where I helped to launch the Young Climate Prize, and worked on TV shoots for BBC Maestro.</p>
